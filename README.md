# Smart Eco-Homes

Smart Eco-Homes is a research and design framework that integrates traditional passive building methods with IoT, renewable energy, water conservation, and waste management technologies for sustainable residential living [file:11].

---

## Overview

The project defines **smart eco-homes** as residential buildings equipped with sensors, automation, and data analytics to optimise energy, water, waste, and indoor environmental quality, while maintaining occupant comfort and safety [file:11]. It is particularly oriented towards the context of developing nations such as India.

## Key Findings

- **Resource reduction:** Potential 75–90% reduction in overall resource consumption compared to conventional homes, depending on context and implementation [file:11].  
- **Water savings:** Rainwater harvesting + greywater recycling can reduce municipal water demand by 30–35% [file:11].  
- **Energy savings:** Solar PV + storage can cut grid electricity use by 50–80%; passive design + smart controls can cut space conditioning energy by 60–80% [file:11].  
- **Waste diversion:** IoT-supported composting and waste management can divert up to 88% of waste from landfills [file:11].  
- **Automation impact:** Geofencing and occupancy-based control can reduce unnecessary consumption by 10–20% [file:11].

## System Architecture (High Level)

A typical smart eco-home in this framework includes [file:11]:

- **Passive envelope:** Orientation, shading, insulation, natural ventilation.  
- **Energy systems:** Rooftop solar PV, battery storage, smart inverters.  
- **Water systems:** Rainwater harvesting, greywater treatment and reuse, efficient fixtures.  
- **Waste systems:** Source segregation, composting, recycling flows.  
- **IoT layer:** Sensors (energy, water, IAQ, occupancy), actuators, gateways.  
- **Control & analytics:** Rule-based and ML-based control, dashboards, mobile interfaces.

---

## Implementation Context

The framework covers both **new construction** and **retrofit** scenarios, with guidelines for architects, engineers, policymakers, and residents [file:11]. It aligns with SDG 6, 7, 11, 12, and 13 by targeting clean water, clean energy, sustainable cities, responsible consumption, and climate action [file:11].
